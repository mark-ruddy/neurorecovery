// - matlab integration
// - exercise data gathering, with frontend->backend data storing
// - Basic implementation of scheduled, 
// - Third exercise video section
// - Finish pptx
// - Therapist has option to add their patients, which will then allow the therapist to see all of their data on a page
  - User with user_type Therapist has a new field added, "patients" which will be a comma deliminated list of patient emails registered to them. The backend will handle defaulting it out in most cases(e.g. for Patient user types)
  - If user_type Therapist, add a button beside their profile button to "my patients", which will direct to a component with a simple form for finding(like search form) and adding patients. 
  - Above/below the form on that component will be that therapists list of registered users, which either expand to their details or route to a new component dedicated for that users info etc.
  - Therapist has access to patient details

// - add recommendations for lower-limb vs upper-limb based on injury type
// - Test all of the above and then move on to styling(.ics file, therapist-patient, new exercise sessions with recommendations)
// - Improve general styling of all pages, better user profile button, better stats exercise session logging, etc.

Future:
